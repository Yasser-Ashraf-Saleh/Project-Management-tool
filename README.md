# Project-Management-tool
The Project Management tool, developed in Python using Tkinter, offers a graphical interface for managing project tasks through Activity On Node (AON), Activity On Arc (AOA), and Project Crashing methodologies, enabling efficient project planning, scheduling, and duration optimization with a user-friendly experience.

## Overview
This Project Management tool is designed to solve three key problems in project management:

* **Activity On Node (AON)**: Helps in visualizing project activities on a node-based diagram to facilitate project planning and scheduling.
* **Activity On Arc (AOA)**: Utilizes arc-based diagrams for representing project activities, enabling a different perspective for project analysis.
* **Project Crashing**: Provides functionalities to analyze and implement project crashing strategies, focusing on reducing project duration while minimizing costs.

## Features

* **GUI Interface**: User-friendly graphical interface to input data and visualize results.
* **AON and AOA Visualization**: Visual representation of project activities in both AON and AOA formats, including critical path identification.
* **Project Crashing Analysis**: Tools to calculate and display the effects of project crashing, including total direct costs.

## User Guide

* **Starting the Program**: Launch the program and select the desired project management tool (AON, AOA, or Project Crashing).
* **Input Data**: Follow the on-screen instructions to enter project data, such as the number of activities and their details.
   - Ensure to use capital letters for activity identifiers and separate multiple activities with commas without spaces.
* **Visualization and Results**: After entering all necessary data, the program will display the project network along with critical paths and, if applicable, crashing analysis results.

## Development Environment
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter
- The project is developed in Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for creating a user-friendly graphical interface. This choice of technologies facilitates cross-platform compatibility and ease of use.
Getting Started
To run the  Project Management tool, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the Tkinter library. Here is a basic guide to get the tool up and running:

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python)

## Installation
- ython Installation: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.
- Verify Tkinter: To check if Tkinter is installed, run python -m tkinter from your command line or terminal. A small window should pop up if Tkinter is correctly installed.
## Running the Tool
- Navigate to the directory containing the project_management.py file.
- Open a terminal or command prompt in this directory.
- Run the command python project_management.py to start the application.
